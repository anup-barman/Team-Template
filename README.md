### Required Packages to compile and make the template

* python3

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install python3
  ```
* texlive-full

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install texlive-full
  ```

* pygments

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install python3-pip
  pip3 install pygments
  ```

* **If failed:**

  You will have to create virtual environment in your project directory and acticate it

  ```bash
  sudo apt install python3-venv
  cd 
  cd your/project/directory/address/here
  python3 -m venv <your_env_name>
  source <your_env_name>/bin/activate
  ```

  Your prompt will change to show (<your_env_name>) at the beginning. 

  Now run the commands to install **pygments**



### How To Use

Put your codes in the **code** folder with .cpp file extention. You can create subfolders (E.g. - Graph, String, Math etc.) for different categories.

Open a terminal in your project directory and run - 

```bash
  python3 main.py
```



### Customization

To customize you need to edit the ```template/template.tex``` file.

- To changed team and contest information, change line 4 - 11.

- To change font size, edit line 1 or change ``scaled=..`` in line 21 (more flexible).
